# Character Reference Image Generation

## CRITICAL: Character Preservation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
The attached reference image shows the character "{character_name}" (representing {character_category}).
You MUST preserve the EXACT appearance of this character:

### REQUIRED - Copy Exactly From Reference:
- **Body shape**: Exact proportions, silhouette, and body structure
- **Face/Eyes**: Same eye shape, size, expression style, and facial features
- **Colors**: IDENTICAL color palette - do not shift or adjust any colors
- **Distinctive features**: All unique design elements (patterns, accessories, textures)
- **Art style**: Match the exact illustration style (line weight, shading, rendering)

### FORBIDDEN - Do Not Change:
- DO NOT redesign or reinterpret the character
- DO NOT change the character's proportions
- DO NOT alter the character's color scheme
- DO NOT add features not present in the reference
- DO NOT use a different art style

## User Request
{prompt}

## How to Combine Character + Request
1. Place the EXACT character from the reference image into the requested scenario
2. Only change the character's pose/action to match the request
3. Add appropriate background/environment for the scenario
4. Keep bright, friendly atmosphere suitable for recycling education

## Quality Standards
- The character should be immediately recognizable as the same character from the reference
- Treat this like official character merchandise - consistency is mandatory
